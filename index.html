    <p id="acceleration-definition"><span class="highlight">Acceleration</span> is the name we give to any process where the velocity changes. Since velocity is a speed and a direction, there are only two ways for you to accelerate: change your speed or change your direction—or change both
    <br>
    That feeling you get when you're sitting in a plane during take-off, or slamming on the brakes in a car, or turning a corner at a high speed in a go kart are all situations where you are accelerating.
    <br>
    <span class="highlight">"Acceleration and velocity are basically the same thing, right?” Wrong</span>. People often erroneously think that if the velocity of an object is large, then the acceleration must also be large. Or they think that if the velocity of an object is small, it means that acceleration must be small. But that “just ain’t so”. <span class="highlight">The value of the velocity at a given moment does not determine the acceleration.</span> In other words, I can be changing my velocity at a high rate regardless of whether I'm currently moving slow or fast.
    <br>
    <span class="highlight">If you’re not changing your speed and you’re not changing your direction, then you simply cannot be accelerating—no matter how fast you’re going</span>. So, a jet moving with a constant velocity at 800 miles per hour along a straight line has zero acceleration, even though the jet is moving really fast, since the velocity isn’t changing. When the jet lands and quickly comes to a stop, it will have acceleration since it’s slowing down.
